An LLM that excels at writing Chinese novels

## **Why?**
My wife loves writing Chinese novels. She uses LLMs to help her write. However, she finds even the most powerful ones sound robotic. Current LLMs lack the poetic feel when speaking Chinese. She asks if I can train an LLM just to help her write Chinese novels. And that, is the birth to this project.

Creative writing is hard. In a poetic language like Chinese? Even harder. Build an LLM for that? Why not? I love the journey, anyway.
